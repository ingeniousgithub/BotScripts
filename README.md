# BotScripts
All the scripts that help make the bots run.

Bring up the Report Navigator in Xcode (it's the comicbook chatbubble-looking thing on the top right-hand-side of the Naviagtion pane).  Click on "Bitteroot's Mac mini", and select one of the Bots and one of their integrations.

Press the "Edit Bot..." button, which is just below the right-hand-side of the Jump Bar. 

This will bring up the EditBot Info screen, which displays the name of the bot and it's server.  

Select the Triggers page. This displays all of the Scripts used to make the bot work.  Each script will call a script in the /Users/xcodeserver/BotScripts directory.
